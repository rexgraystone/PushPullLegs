# Push Pull Legs

This repository contains .csv files of my personal progress doing Jeff Nippard's [Push Pull Legs Routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVek72z3F1U). I have modified some exercises from the video to my personal preferences.

My current workout split is as follows:  
    1. Monday - Leg Day 1 (Quad Focused)  
    2. Tuesday - Push Day 1 (Lower Chest Focused)  
    3. Wednesday - Pull Day 1 (Lat Focused)  
    4. Thursday - Leg Day 2 (Glutes/Hamstring Focused)  
    5. Friday - Push Day 2 (Upper Chest Focused)  
    6. Saturday - Pull Day 2 (Mid Back Focused)  
    7. Sunday - Rest  

The workouts have been logged since January 18th, 2023. All weights are in pounds.
In addition to the .csv files, I have also performed data analysis in R Programming.
