# Push Pull Legs

This repository contains my personal progress doing the Push Pull Legs split. Most of the exercises in this list are taken from Jeff Nippard's [Push Pull Legs Routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVek72z3F1U).
My current workout split is as follows:
Monday - Leg Day 1 (Quad Focused)
Tuesday - Push Day 1 (Lower Chest Focused)
Wednesday - Pull Day 1 (Lat Focused)
Thursday - Leg Day 2 (Glutes/Hamstring Focused)
Friday - Push Day 2 (Upper Chest Focused)
Saturday - Pull Day 2 (Mid Back Focused)
Sunday - Rest
